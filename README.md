# Preamble
Hey, stranger! In this chapter of my repositorial life, i'll try to make something i have never done before -- to design a cpu and build an assembler for it.

The project is considered to be a one-time, working-on-weekends, no-huge-plans-involved, and probably a long-term one. 

# Design decisions
The actual cpu is going to be built in Logisim Evolution. Speaking of assembler, the latter will be written in C++.
